# PORTAFOLIO ANGULAR

This proyect focus on how to convert an HTML template to an Angular App, using, 
Firebase real-time data base as a backend, deploying the website to vercel and using
Git as a repository.

We will focus on learning by doing, we will create everything from scratch, that 
includes setting up the database and repositories to work on GitHub and Git.
